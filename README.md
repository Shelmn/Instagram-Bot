# Instagram-Bot
A Website Automation App Which'll Follow, Unfollow, Like, Comment With A Single Click.

Requirments : Google Chrome, Java Development Kit(JDK), Eclipse(Only If You Want to Modify Source Code). 

There Are Two Ways to Run This Application : Both Require You To Put chromedriver.exe to "C:/chromedriver.exe". Do this First.

1. If You Just Want To Run The App Then, Download The InstagramBot.jar And Double Click On it. You Must Have chromedriver.exe in "C:/chromedriver.exe".
   
2. If You Want To Modify And Run And Test Then, Download InstaBot and Instabot.java . Insta Bot Contains Jar Files, Build Jar Files With Eclipse, Then Run The Code. You Must Have chromedriver.exe in "C:/chromedriver.exe".

This App Was Real Fast, I made It Run Slow So Instagram Could Not Detect The Bot.
