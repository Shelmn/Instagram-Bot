# Instagram-Bot
A Website Automation App Which'll Follow And Unfollow People With A Single Click.

There Are Two Ways to Run This Application : 

1. Download And Extract Zip File, You'll See Two Files, Jar File And exe File, Place chromedriver.exe into your C Drive Path Should Be        "C:/chromedriver.exe" Now You're Ready To Test Instagram Bot, Just Double Click On Jar File And See Bot Doing Things.
   If Follow Is Clicked, Try Clicking Again.
   
2. With The Source Code Download All The Jar Files And Build Them With Eclips, Then Run The Code.

This App Was Real Fast, I made It Run Slow So Instagram Could Not Detect The Bot.
